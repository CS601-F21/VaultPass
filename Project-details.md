## About

### Motivation:
The motivation behind developing VaultPass was to have an easy to use password manager that is hosted locally. The existing cloud based 
password managers are complicated and cluttered with so many multiple use cases. It gets difficult to store and manage passwords for people 
who are not into technology (like my parents). With this project i want to develop a minimal password manager that my parents can use easily.

Also i wanted to learn Django since last few months and therefore decided to use this opportunity.


### Features:
* VaultPass supports following features:
  * encrypt and decrypt passwords
  * retrieve and store passwords in database
  * random password generator
  * view and delete passwords
  * set password hint
  * change master password
  * multiple user support
  * copy password
  * copy username
  
* Future features
  * better UI
  * email verification
  * identify stored websites with same passwords
  * store notes securely
  

### Tech stack:
I used Python and Django framework for the backend and HTML, CSS, Javascript for the front-end.
